What is Rolling_Mean?
A rolling mean, also known as a moving average, is a statistical calculation used in time series analysis to analyze data points over a specific window of time. It is commonly used to smooth out fluctuations or noise in a time series data set, making underlying trends or patterns more apparent. Here's how a rolling mean works:

Window: A rolling mean involves selecting a fixed window of a specified size or time period. This window "rolls" through the data. The size of the window is determined by the analyst or user and can be days, months, or any other unit of time, depending on the data and analysis goals.

Calculation: For each position of the rolling window, the rolling mean is calculated by averaging the values within that window. The mean is computed for the data points within the window, and the result is assigned to the midpoint of the window.

Smoothing: The rolling mean effectively smooths the data. It replaces each data point with an average of the data points around it. This helps to reduce noise or short-term fluctuations, making it easier to identify longer-term trends or patterns.

Visualization: The rolling mean can be plotted on a graph to provide a smoother representation of the data. It is often used in time series analysis to visualize trends or to remove seasonality and cyclicality.

Applications: Rolling means are used in various fields, including finance (e.g., to analyze stock prices), economics (e.g., to examine economic indicators), and signal processing (e.g., for smoothing signals). They are also applied in quality control and other areas to detect patterns and anomalies.

The choice of the window size is a critical aspect of using rolling means. Smaller window sizes are more responsive to short-term fluctuations, while larger window sizes provide a smoother, more long-term view of the data. The specific choice of window size depends on the nature of the data and the goals of the analysis.

This is an interpretation of this graph:
We have monthly sales data for a year, represented by the 'Sales' column.

We calculate a 3-month rolling mean, which means that for each data point in the 'Rolling Mean' column, it is the average of the current month's sales and the two previous months.

We use matplotlib to plot both the original sales data and the rolling mean on the same graph.

The original data is represented by the blue line with markers, while the rolling mean is shown in red with a dashed line.

Interpretation of the plot:

The blue line represents the actual monthly sales data, which can be noisy and exhibit fluctuations.
The red dashed line represents the 3-month rolling mean, which smooths out the fluctuations, making it easier to see the underlying trend in sales.
